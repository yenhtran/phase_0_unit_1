# U1.W2: Chrome Dev Tools Challenge Reflection

* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?

DOM "is a programming interface for HTML documents. It provides a structured representation fo the document and it defines a way that the structure can be accessed from programs so that they can change the document structure, styale and content." From what I can interpret from all the reading materials, I KIND of understand it. It still will take some time for me to fully grasp the concept. For now, all I understand is that the DOM is what stand between HTML and the web brower. You need the DOM for the browser to interpret the web document.  

* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?

I LOVE the Chrome Web Tools. I really enjoyed the immediate gratification of when you make an adjustment, you can see the changes immediately. This tool will definately help me as I continue to learn web development. 

* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?

LOVED it. 

* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?

Aha moment- by clicking any section on a website will automatically direct you to the section of code in the Element. (When I finally figured it out, it helped saved tons of time because I didn't have to search for it.)

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
