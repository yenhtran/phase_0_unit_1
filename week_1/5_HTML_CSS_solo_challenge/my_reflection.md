That...was...painful. I must have spent more than an hour trying to figure out how to get my footer to stay on the bottom of the page. (I ended up using 'wrap') I have to admit that I had no choice but to look at other resources to figure out this problem. In addition, due to the time pressure, I do not feel very good with my understanding of CSS. (I'll probably be spending a lot of time doing CSS on Khan Academy.) As much as I like the 'Girl Develop It' slides, I don't think they give a good practical use understanding of CSS. They explained the concepts individually, but it's missing the actually intergration of all the concepts and actually inputing into the text editor. I had no choice but to Google simple website to look at the layout of the syntax to help guide me to the problem. 

I don't feel very comfortable with CSS at the moment and will probably have to go through a complete tutorial on it through some of the optional resources when I have some time. 

(FYI- I had some computer issues that prevented me from starting Week 1 assignments until yesterday. Hence- the time crunch. On the good side- I have a new Macbook Pro! :)
