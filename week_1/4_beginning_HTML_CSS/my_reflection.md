1) Most of the html syntax was pretty straightforward but will take time and practice to get used to. What I had the hardest time was the overall structure of entire html document. 

2) Good- straightforward enough to learn. Bad- it is pretty irritating to constantly have to open/close every tag, but I understand why.

3) For some reason I had a hard time getting my HTML and CSS linked up. When I figured out what was wrong (missing a semi-colon), that was my 'aha' moment.

4) While the Girl Develop It site gave a good overview, I didn't feel like there was enough hands-on excercises to actually put into practice. Other resources I used was http://docs.railsbridge.org/frontend/, and Youtube videos.
