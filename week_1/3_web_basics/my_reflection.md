1) I learned tons! Two of the most important things I learned and most struggled with were the DNS and IP concepts. The concept was a bit hard to grasp and had to look up some Youtube videos about DNS to help supplement the article.

2) When setting up your HTML site, be sure to add a header and a body. Make sure to tag (and close the tag) everything!

3) At the beginning I wasn't actually sure if it went live. I had noticed that the address started with 'file:///User/yentran/yenhtran.github.io'. I then tinkered around with it and deleted the 'file:///User/yentran' and replaced it with 'http://' and it worked! I actually am more pleased with myself that I was able to figure out on this problem on my own than whether or not my website went live or not. (Yes, I am excited that it went live. :)

4) My 'aha' moment was when I solved my 'live' problem in #3. Another 'aha' moment was when I finally understood the concepts of DNS and IP. (At work we sometimes IT problems that involved "Someone is using your IP address, so your network connection isn't working." I now understand at a deeper level what they are talking about.)

5) I'm a big fan of educational videos. Whenever I don't understand a complex concept, I have found there is always a Youtube video out there that will help explain these complex concepts. In the case of the DNS concept, I found this video incredibly useful to understanding DNS: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwpP8PUzqLw
