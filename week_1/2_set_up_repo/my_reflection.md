## 2. [Open Source and Repo Setup](2_set_up_repo/readme.md) Reflection

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person
* Describe what open source means
* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
* Assess the importance of using licenses
* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

1) Log into github.com. Once you do, select the "Repository" tab at the top of the page and click on the green "New" button. 
2) Open source software "is the practice of sharing how a computer program was made and allowing anyone to customize the program as they see fit". This philosphy allows any developer to access these programs and share what they have contributed. It is a very communal environment, and is vibrant because of this. And because it is free, drives more people to the organization and could also lead to developers contributing to make it a better product for the company. I would also suspect that this provides great exposure to the company through word of mouth.

3) From what I have read so far, I think Open Source is a great practice that allows the developer community to grow and connect. It's a great platform for developers to collaborate, teach, learn, etc. I would like to think that because it is a product of the community, developers would want to ensure that the product is exceptional.

4) Licensing is important becuase it "grants specific permissions for others to use your work". By using Open-source licenses, it makes for others to contribute to a project without having to request permission. It also allows the creator to get some credit for the initial work and not allow other to claim that the work was theirs. Who would want to do all the work to only allow others to take the credit?

5) My only struggle with this excercise was that I was unable to install the Github App because I was running Snow Leopard 10.6 and the app required 10.7 or higher. Unfortunatly for me, my computer was too old to install 10.7, which resulted in getting a new computer. (It is like night and day.)
