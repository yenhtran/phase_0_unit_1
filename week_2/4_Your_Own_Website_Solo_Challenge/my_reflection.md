# U1.W2: Design, User Experience, and creating your website Reflection

My Website url: http://yenhtran.github.io/unit1_projects/dbc1.html

Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience? 
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)
* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?
* What would you like to add or change about the site next?
* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

Prior to this week, I had been doing my own research in UX design and would like to delve more into it. I find the approach very interesting. My only problem is that I need to work on my CSS. I will probably be adding additonal CSS work/tutorials to focus on because I still don't think I have a good enough grasp. I really enjoyed the design/user experience and really liked the wireframing exercise.
