# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?
* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?
* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?
* Why is reset.css necessary? 
* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

I think the standard structure makes sense to me. I think I was apply some of the concepts the slides mentioned. In regards to HTML5 elements, I did think that the `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav` tags makes the html documents much cleaner without all those "<div>" tags. As for why reset.css was  necessary, I'm not exactly sure why it was necessary. I have used IE, Firefox, Safari, and Chrome and did sometimes notice that some sites did look different but didn't know why until now.

Here was a great video tutorial that explained @face-font very well- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoglqAkvNBA
