# U1.W2: Responsive Design Reflection

* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?
* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?
* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?
* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

Responsive web design is 'a set of techniques and ideas that form a whole' approach aimed at designing sites to maximize a user's viewing experience across multiple devices with different viewpoints. I think it's a great practice if we could make products user-friendly. There has been so many times when I try to use new products, and if it is confusing/hard to navigate, I generally give up on the product all together. I didn't need it before, and if the product can't make my life easier or more enjoyable- I don't need it. Therefore I would think making a product user-friendly is incredibly important when you are trying to pull in new users. 

Smartphones and tablets have definitely changed (if not the main reason) web design. These innovations have pushed web designs to rethink the design approach. I think it is just going to keep changing with the explosion of wearable technologies like Google Glass, and Apple Watches are only going push responsive design even farther to the limit.

I definitely think it would be incredibly hard to design a website for the visually impaired as websites in general are such visual products. However, I don't think we should exclude them when designing a product. Perhaps adding vocal cues that would accept vocal answers to navigate? With the introduction of Apple's Siri, I don't think it's impossible.

The concept that resonated with me the most was how using media queries could help adjust the website to better fit the device I am using.

I love Treehouse.
