## 1. [Git and Github](1_get_started/readme.md) Reflection

* What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
* Write an explanation of and compare git and GitHub to a non-technical audience. 
* Describe what version control is and how GitHub helps with it.
* Why do developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not?
* What doesn't make sense? What does?

1) Over the past couple of months I have done my best to attend as many Ruby meetups, study groups and workshops to prepare myself for the onslaught of learning that is going to come my way this July. So I had created a git and GitHub account and was able to follow along for the most part. What I have learned is that I understand the general concept of git and Github, but since I'm more of an applied learner, I won't be able to fully know how to use all the commands until I am working on an exercise or project that requires me to use it. For now, a general understanding of what git and GitHub does will have to do. Oh- and I need a new computer. Found out that GitHub no longer provides a application for OS 10.6.8. (My computer is so old that it won't run OS 1.7. I tried looking for older exisiting version, but was unsuccessful.) This old computer is starting to wear on me anyway...

2) I have to say I really enjoyed Stephanie Oh's article "Git vs. GitHub for Dummies". Her simplified explanation of how Git was a great version-control software that lives locally on your computer, like any other application (ex. Skype). Github on the other hand, lives remotely on the Internet and is a great tool for collaborating projects amongst a team at the same time. In addition, by commiting often allows you to access to your project anywhere. (Her oversimplification of "GitHub is to Git what Dropbox is to the flashstick" was great.)

3) 'Version control' allows you to manage and keep track of all the changes to your projects. Everytime you commit, it takes a 'snapshot' of your work and saves a version of it. Therefore if you ever make a mistake on a particular version of your project, you can go back to the last saved version before your mistake and continue working from there. Or if you for some reason deleted all your work in a particular version, you have past version to work from- saving you a lot of time and heartache. Github really comes into the picture as a collaboration tool. When working as part of a team, there needs to be a system to manage multiple individual's version of the project and their respective changes. 

4) Using git makes complete sense to me. I wish we had a similar function in my current job. Being able to constantly save versions and refer back to older versions when the new version isn't working out can be tremendously useful. How many times have I accidently lost a project because it was accidentally deleted? It was painful for me, I can imagine how painful it is for someone who has put 100+ manhours into a project.

5) So far most of the "Get Started" section makes sense. I've had a couple of errors when trying to use git on my computer. I'm hoping to work out the errors soon.
