# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 
* How will you combat that? 
* What techniques will you try?
* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?

I think my biggest time management challenge has been distractions. Whether it be emails, facebook, phone, etc. Also, I keep trying to push myself to try and learn this stuff in EPIC timeframes (i.e. 8 hours) instead of 45 min increments w/ 10 min breaks.
 
What I'm going to do immediately is schedule and set aside dedicated time for programming, and programming only. I will be disconnecting from my emails, phone, during these allocated times. Next, I will be setting these timeframes to 45min sessions w/ 10 minute breaks in-between instead of those epic marathons. 

I think my overall plan to tackle Phase 0 is to do what I have stated above. Then actually TRACK my progress against how many hours it takes me to finish a challenge. I've come to the realization that my time management skills need some work. I'm hoping that through this exercise I will be much more efficient and productive with my work. After tracking my progress, then assess and go from there. It could be adding more 45 min sessions in my day or maybe more tutoring help/ pair programming sessions. I'll cross that bridge when I get to it.
