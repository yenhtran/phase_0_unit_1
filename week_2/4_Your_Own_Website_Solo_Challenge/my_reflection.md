# U1.W2: Design, User Experience, and creating your website Reflection

My Website url: http://yenhtran.github.io/unit1_projects/dbc1.html

Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience? 
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)
* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?
* What would you like to add or change about the site next?
* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

Prior to this week, I had been doing my own research in UX design and would like to delve more into it. I find the approach very interesting. My only problem is that I need to work on my CSS. I will probably be adding additonal CSS work/tutorials to focus on because I still don't think I have a good enough grasp. I really enjoyed the design/user experience and really liked the wireframing exercise. 

So far my process has been: 
1)looking up websites I like
2)looking up how to replicate certain elements (ie. navigation tab) in Youtube and try to recreate it
3)try and see if I could add some usability to it.
Currently I am not happy with how this process went, but hoping that this process could be modified.

In regards on how I would change the site, I can't seem to figure out how to fix my picture so that it stays put when I scroll. (My ultimate goal is to put all the text stuff in the ABOUT page and leave the home page relatively empty and clean.)

I found a lot of the listed resources in this section great. I also supplemented with Youtube videos.
